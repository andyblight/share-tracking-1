# Share Tracking Database

Python wrapper around a SQLite database that is used to track the buying and
selling of my shares.

## Usage

To do a fresh install:

```bash
cd share-tracking-1
pip install .
```

`pip` will install any dependencies for you.  The dependencies are defined in
the `setup .py` file.

To start the program:

```bash
cd share-tracking-1
./gui_main.py
```

To operate the program, guess from the menu options!
